# Monte Carlo Simulation based on Zohran Mamdani Policies

This project aims to answer the question "Q. Can Zohran Mamdani Afford His Policies?".
This project is a Monte Carlo Simulation Using NYC's FY 2025 Budget

The central question is 
"Can Zohran Mamdani afford his proposed policies using a Monte Carlo budget simulation?"

The analysis uses real New York City financial data from the FY 2025 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) and simulates the fiscal impact of several policy proposals, including free buses, a grocery stipend, rent freeze support, administrative overhead, and rare housing-related payouts.

This repository evaluates whether these policies are fiscally feasible when added to NYC's actual 2025 financial structure.


## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the Kaggle Notebook:

NYC Policy Monte Carlo Simulation

This project builds upon the work already established by the kaggle notebook by using audited financial data from New York City's FY 2025 ACFR.

A special thank you to the orignial author for the inspiration for this project.
